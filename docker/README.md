# Orchestra Docker

This is just a simpler way to deploy stuff and keep it running (forced with "restart unless stopped").

## Instructions

* First you have to build it:

```
make build
```

* Then just run it :)

```
make run
```

* If you run it on a screen and detach from it, it'll keep running forever.
* If you wish to stop it, do `docker stop <container-name>`
